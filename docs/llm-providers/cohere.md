## Rate Limits

Cohere enforces rate limits based on your plan:

|------|--------------|------------|
| Trial | 20 | 100,000 |
| Production | 1,000+ | 100,000+ |

Check your limits in the Cohere dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

Invalid API key:

```
ERROR: Provider returned 401
```

Fix: Verify your API key in the Cohere dashboard.

### 429 Rate Limited

```
ERROR: Provider returned 429
```

Fix: Wait before retrying or upgrade your plan.

### Model Not Found

```
ERROR: Model 'xyz' not found
```

Fix: Check that you're using a valid Cohere model ID from their documentation.

## Long-running conversations with Cohere

Bridge's immortal mode keeps history bounded with **in-place forgecode-style compaction** — pure code, no extra LLM call. Set `config.immortal` and choose a budget appropriate for the model.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "immortal": {
      "token_budget": 80000,
      "retention_window": 15,
      "eviction_window": 0.5,
      "expose_journal_tools": true
    }
  }
}
```

See [Immortal Mode](../core-concepts/agents.md#immortal-mode) for the full configuration.
