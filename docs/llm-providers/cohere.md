## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

Invalid API key:

```
ERROR: Provider returned 401
```

Fix: Verify your API key in the Cohere dashboard.

### 429 Rate Limited

```
ERROR: Provider returned 429
```

## Compaction with Cohere

For long conversations, use a cheaper model for compaction:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "compaction": {
      "token_budget": 80000,
      "tail_messages": 10,
      "summary_provider": {
        "provider_type": "cohere",
        "model": "command-light",
        "api_key": "your-cohere-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
